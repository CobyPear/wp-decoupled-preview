## TODO
* Brian and Abishek should make WordPress.org profiles to ensure they are properly credited in the plugin - https://profiles.wordpress.org/
* ~~full~~ update readme.txt
	* Long description required from Decoupled team
	* Brian and Abishek added to readme.txt
* deploy to WP.org workflows
* ~~WPCS linting~~
* domain path is defined but there is no /languages folder
* I've allowed short array syntax in the PHPCS ruleset but there's inconsistency between using short arrays and not. One thing _or_ the other should be used, not both~~, and that rule should be added & enforced~~.
* nonce validation
* global $pagenow used in open scope
* all strings should be run through i18n functions
